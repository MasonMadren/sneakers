<ul>
  <li>4."Nike Air Foamposites” </li>
  		<p> In 1997, things were pretty typical for Basketball shoes. Leather, Mesh and Suede were the go to fabrics, but Nike decided the hell with that, let’s make an entirely different synthetic material that’s (at the time) light weight, flexible and doesn’t crease.</p>

  <li>3. "Air Jordan 4´s” </li>
  		<p>The Air Jordan 4 is from 1989 and it is not only influential, but it’s also probably the coolest sneaker ever. Not only did it have the greatest feature of the period — a visible air bubble — but it came packed full of things you thought you’d never ever see on a basketball sneaker; plastic reinforced eyelets on plastic wings, an extended heel tab to pull the shoes on and off and an extended tongue that made the sneaker feel like it was more a fashion piece than a hoop shoe</p>

  <li>2. "Jordan 11´s”</li>
  		<p>Tinker had nothing left to prove when he took on the Air Jordan 11 in 1995.        
      The dude had racked up so many classic silhouettes over the past decade and more, that he could have easily opted for something a little more, basic.The creation influenced an entire decade of patent leather popularity for sneakers. The material has now become a staple consideration of any sneaker design process.</p>

<p>
  <li>1. "Jordan 1´s"</li>
      <p>Air Jordans changed the whole dynamic in 1985, leveraging such a niche product to the masses via an extraordinarily talented and equally marketable athlete. It was also a pure chance that it was birthed around the same time as peak-level sports endorsements, which in itself was bigger than the Air Jordan 1.</p>
